# Image Processing with Edge Detection

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing techniques, including converting an image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction, and performing edge detection using the Canny algorithm.

## Prerequisites

* Python (3.x recommended)
* Libraries:
    * OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
    * Pillow (`Pillow`)
    * Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
    * Requests (`requests`)

You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless Pillow matplotlib requests
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
   ```

2. **Replace the image URL:**

   * Open the `script.py` file.
   * Find the line `image_path = ...` and replace the placeholder URL with the URL of the image you want to process.

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

## Explanation

* **Device Selection:** The script checks if a GPU is available and uses it for computation if possible. Otherwise, it falls back to the CPU.
* **Image Loading:**  The image is loaded from the provided URL using the `requests` library.
* **Grayscale Conversion:** The image is converted to grayscale using OpenCV's `cvtColor` function.
* **Gaussian Blur:** A Gaussian blur is applied to reduce noise in the image.
* **Canny Edge Detection:** The Canny edge detection algorithm is used to identify prominent edges in the image.
* **Visualization:** The original image, grayscale image, blurred image, and edge-detected image are displayed using Matplotlib.

## Output

The script will display four images:

1. Original Image
2. Grayscale Image
3. Blurred Image
4. Edge Detected Image

## Notes

* Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
* You can experiment with different image URLs and Canny threshold values to see how they affect the edge detection results.
